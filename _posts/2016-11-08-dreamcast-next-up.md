We’ve been modifying some of the current guides up. With the transition complete it feels like the time to add a new console to the lineup. Up next was the last console release from SEGA, and they ended their releases with a storm. The Dreamcast.

Dreamcast was the first console to start the [sixth generation of consoles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_generation_of_video_game_consoles). While it was the under-performer of the generation, the vast array of different types of games and accessories made this console a commercial success. This console saw the release of arguably the only successful Sonic RPG, Sonic Adventures.

Behind the Dreamcast is a utility that came to light _after_ support was dropped, that was the [VMU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMU). The Virtual Memory Unit pioneered by SEGA, featured a controller slot-in. This slot-in not only let you store game data, but also had interactions with games by the way of a screen. Dreamcast games could utilise this screen however they wish, normally to display some game art. Pull the VMU out of the controller though, and you find a tiny set of controls. You can interact with many games, and even have a tamagochi-like pet by the way of Sonic Adventures.

In the coming weeks we will be doing some polishing to the site and adding to the currently sparse FAQ sections, but we will then add the Dreamcast in time for Christmas and the server migration.

**Update:** This is still in the pipe-works, and will be ready once we have the necessary resources. In the mean time we have been updating the site otherwise, but rest assured it’s still on the way.
