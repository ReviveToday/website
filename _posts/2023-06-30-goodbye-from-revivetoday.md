After **seven years** of running **ReviveToday** (originally **RetroPlayStation**), a website dedicated to preserving the memories and joys of old consoles, I have made the difficult decision to bring this chapter to a close. The site will be gradually phased out, and until the interests fades will [redirect visitors to where they can find up to date information]({% link alternatives.md %}).

ReviveToday was born out of my personal passion for the nostalgia-inducing consoles that ignited our love for gaming. Over the years this site has guided (if analytics are to be believed) many people into the world of bringing a new life to their consoles through custom firmware, homebrew and the like. I am immensely grateful for the support and engagement from our community members, whose enthusiasm fueled this journey during this time.

When I started this site, I was in early years of the working world and had buckets of time available to build this website to where it was today. Unfortunately nowadays this is no longer the case, and has been noticable to the point that the once up-to-date guide promise has now stalled massively. I've noticed in various discussion groups how the site went from being shared for the latest information, to being warned that the guides and information on the site are now outdated. I would love nothing more than to ensure it is up to date, but unfortunately I no longer have the time or energy to achieve this.

In this time, there has been an incredible boom of guides and communities appearing that provide significantly better support than I could ever achieve now. I am gadly happy to hand the reigns over to these many communities that work to ensure this information is up to date.

Thank you for joining me on this wild ride, and I wish you all success with your console endeavours.

## FAQ

### Where do I go?

**See the [alternatives page]({% link alternatives.md %})** for where you can find resources that are more up-to-date than this website. Upon full closure, this page will remain until the site ends.

### What will happen to the site?

As a promise that has echoed over the years, **the site will be backed up into the Internet Archive**. That way this informaton is not lost, and still present on the internet in some form or another. Some warnings will be put up first to ensure legacy website diggers know that the information might be detrimental.

The website will then be replaced with pages that will point landers to where they could find the information they were otherwise looking for. There's no specific preference with this, and I'll be basing the recommendations on various sources of information I've been gathering since the decision was made.

Due to some legal and logistical issues, the site will **not** be transferred to a new owner.

### When will this happen?

Provisions are already in place to start directing people to alternative informational resources, so it is already in progress. The notice will then turn into a complete removal towards the third quarter of the year.

**SEO has already been disabled** - this means the site will start disappearing off search engines, and competing guides can overtake the search rankings.

### What happens to the site resources?

The only 'protected' content is the help and article pages themselves. These are listed under a [Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license. This incredibly catchy name means - in summary - that the content can be re-used so long as attribution back is made and it's not used in a commercial environment. Most of this content is outdated at this point, so feel free to use it as a starting point (or just use ChatGPT, it seems to have stored this stuff anyway).

All code for this website [can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/ReviveToday).

### What about Discord and other social media?

The Discord server has been taken under different management. They'll continue to operate it under their own discretion. The rest of the social media has been dormant for a long time and will be shut down.
