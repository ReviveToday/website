Hello all!

Here at Retro PlayStation we discovered that we have a couple of issues. Our domain name is very specific, in that we provide services for the older PlayStation consoles. However, We used ‘PlayStation’ in the name. Most of you will know that PlayStation is a [trademark of Sony Interactive Entertainment Incorporated](https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/legal/copyright-and-trademark-notice/). We added warnings to stay we are not affiliated to or endorsed by Sony, but the trademark violation still exists. With a mission to stay active for as long as possible, a simple cease and desist from Sony could immediately knock the site permanently offline.

Asides from blatant trademark issues, we also do not intend to serve _just_ PlayStation models. We already have Dreamcast and Nintendo DS in our lineup, so Retro PlayStation is in essence rather misleading for our future ventures.

So we have decided to migrate our site to a new domain. Starting Sunday, we will be found at revive.today, and be called – [you guessed it](https://revive.today) – Revive Today.

We will aim to provide a great service across many existing and newly retro consoles, and still provide a great service to the PlayStation lineage. We will redirect requests to Retro PlayStation over to our new site, so you should not have to worry about any existing links. Also, should our website redirect unsuccessfully, we have been fully archived on the [WayBack Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://retroplaystation.com/).

So that’s our news for today. Please let us know what you think in the comments below!

_Please note we have not actually been served a C&D from Sony. We are just preparing for the future._
