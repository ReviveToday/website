title:  "ReviveToday Inbox has been Closed"

---

I have enjoyed chatting with many of you over the years via the inbox (admin@revive.today), and many discussions and website ideas & decisions have come from said discussions. Unfortunately, due to a rise in spam and abuse being sent to this inbox, and the pressure to rely on paid email services, the inbox has been terminated. Emails sent to this inbox will no longer be seen or replied to.

All references and mentions on the site have been adjusted for this change. A notice of closure was supposed to be sent from the inbox, however I've been since notified that this does not work.

The following are now the alternative options:
* For discussions on all things retro, please consider joining the [ReviveToday Discord](http://revive.today/discord).
* For website matters, please use the [Contact form](http://revive.today/contact).

Thank you for your understanding, and hope to see you on the Discord server.
