_New Super Mario Brothers_ for Nintendo DS isn’t so new any more. In fact, it’s now almost 11 years old. It’s running platform, the world-famous Nintendo DS, is now around 12 years old in itself, and only saw the end of the DS line in 2011. A 6 year official lifespan with a massive range of variations gives it one of the longest lifespans of a handheld console. Sadly however, a mild homebrew community meant that it is now mostly unheard of, combined with a successor with an [awfully similar name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_3DS).

In the coming months ([we mean it this time]({% post_url 2016-11-08-dreamcast-next-up %})), we will be adding a new section covering the hidden homebrews of the Nintendo DS. we will point you to the best community locations, guides, options and homebrews available for your DS. DSi will also be included in these guides, however personally I never owned one of these incredible little devices.

Meanwhile, [we are still working on the Dreamcast section]({% post_url 2016-11-08-dreamcast-next-up %}). We have had a couple of setbacks due to server issues, but rest assured we will be adding them to the site in the near future! As always, any concerns just let us know.
