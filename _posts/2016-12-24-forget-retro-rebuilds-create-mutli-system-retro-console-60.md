With a revival of interest in older video games, a few old console companys have re-produced anniversary editions of their consoles. Sinclair has released the [ZX Vega](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-sinclair-zx-spectrum-vega-plus-console-games#/), and Nintendo released the adorable little [NES Classic](https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Misc-/Nintendo-Classic-Mini-Nintendo-Entertainment-System/Nintendo-Classic-Mini-Nintendo-Entertainment-System-1124287.html). Are you awaiting your favourite console to undergo their transformation? Well, why wait when you can build your own?

The low-cost IoT board Raspberry Pi is a powerful little board of delights, and a delight in this situation is that it’s capable of running games up to PlayStation 1. As a result, the board is a great candidate for building your own DIY Retro games console. All in all, a decent build of this console will only cost around £60, which is _less_ than some of these rebuilds.

The guide is currently on-going. If you’re tempted by this and wish to give it a shot, check the link below!
