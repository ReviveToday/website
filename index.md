title: End of ReviveToday

After seven years of running ReviveToday, a website dedicated to preserving the memories and joys of old consoles, I have made the difficult decision to bring this chapter to a close. The site will be gradually phased out, and until the interests fades will redirect visitors to where they can find up to date information.

In this time, there has been an incredible boom of guides and communities appearing that provide significantly better support than I could ever achieve now. I am gadly happy to hand the reigns over to these many communities that work to ensure this information is up to date.

For more information, please see the [closing blog post](https://web.archive.org/web/2/https://revive.today/blog/goodbye-from-revivetoday).

## Alternatives

### PlayStation Portable

* **PSP-Cult** in the ReviveToday Discord has already shown to be a true dedicated PSP officionado. [You can check out their site](https://sites.google.com/view/psp-cult/cfw-hacking-guide) for more up to date information across the whole PSP spectrum.
* For **video guidance**, I recommend [**MrMario2011** YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=MrMario2011+psp). They always seem to produce videos at lightning speed when new updates or changes to jailbreak methods work, and has been a staple in my retro diet for the past 3 years.
* The [Reddit PSP Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSP/) is incredibly active at ~82k active users.
* The [PSP Discord](https://discord.gg/sX2RuKTvgV) and [PSP Homebrew Community](https://discord.gg/bePrj9W) are recommended for getting into the community.

### PlayStation 2

* Recommending **[MrMario2011 again](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=MrMario2011+ps2)** as a treasure trove of video guidance. However [MattKC](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mattkc+ps2) and more technically [Modern Vintage Gamer](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mvg+ps2) are also some good channels to follow for PS2 content. 
* The [PS2 Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ps2/) have a [community wiki](https://consolemods.org/wiki/PS2:PS2_Mods_Wiki) going to supply information on the PS2.
* The [PS2 Discord](https://discord.gg/eFeKhCGDCK) is incredibly active and lively, with some amazing development work underway on the PS2 to make it unbelivably powerful. Well worth joining to see the amazing work going down.

### PlayStation Vita

* For modding the Vita, [Vita Hacks Guide](https://vita.hacks.guide/) is recommended. 
* Vita Homebrew has a massive community on [Reddit under r/Vitahacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/vitahacks/).

### PlayStation 3

* For video guides I recommend a combination of [MrMario2011](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mrmario2011+ps3) and [ModdedWarfare](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=moddedwarfare+ps3).
* [PS3 Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS3) for general use, and the [PS3 Hacks Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ps3homebrew/) for Homebrew.
* [The Console Mods Wiki](https://consolemods.org/wiki/PS3:PS3_Mods_Wiki) is incredibly useful guide for all things modding and homebrew.
