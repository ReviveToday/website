With a 12 year reign, the PlayStation 2 was one of Sony’s most successful gaming console releases of the sixth generation consoles, and even had a place in the seventh. The original PlayStation saw the revolution of gaming turn to more realistic experiences, and made the extremely hard work of the early consoles show their age. The PlayStation 2 multiplied this and gave us brand new experiences. From a semi-realistic driving experience of Gran Turismo 4, the thrill of illegal street racing with the Need for Speed series, and even touched the experience of being in an active warzone with Medal of Honour.

The console was a powerhouse, with the big limitation of the console being the snail pace DVD drive. The console was a beast, and a couple of years after the initial release it became the beast that sat in nearly every living room across the world.
