### The Elder Scrolls: Arena & Daggerfall (DOS)

Bethesda Softworks have released some of their original classics from the _Elder Scrolls_ franchise. These are the original releases designed for DOS, so you will need to be comfortable setting up games using DOSBox, or an old Windows 9x machine.

Bethesda has very kindly provided a thorough step-by-step for DOSBox, and there are community builds to side-step using DOSBox altogether if you just want to get to the game.

_The Elder Scrolls: Arena_ was the first entry in the series! The latest multiplayer title _Elder Scrolls Online_ takes place across the whole of Tamriel, but did you know Arena did it first? Arena is set in the **entire continent** of Tamriel, which includes Morrowind, Cryodil (Oblivion), and even Skyrim. This is Tamriel under the rule of Septim, before the bloodline died out after the Oblivion crisis. As a result, you get a chance to see Tamriel not ravaged by Daedric and Faction wars.

If you’ve not played the originals before, you will need to adjust to the controls as they can take some getting used to. If you have played _Doom_ before, you should get to grips with them quite easily. This also comes before strict game rating guidlines, so expect full nudity, brutality and all sorts of unsual taboos.

For _The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall_, the map has been shrunk down to only allow travels around the Daggerfall province. This is an area between High Rock and Hammerfell for those versed in the geography of Tamriel.

In turn this brings with it a more immersive storyline, more detailed areas and transport, improved dungeon systems and better combat. This also allows you to freely move the camera around, and see where you could not before.

This game is also set in the era of the Septims, and you will encounter Mannimarco, who is featured in _Elder Scrolls Online_.  

Editor’s note: At the time of first publish, they actually provided the o**riginal disc package** with **Dosbox** packaged in. This hasn’t changed, but now they are encouraging you to use their **Bethnet** platform. This will arguably make it easier to run on PC, but if you’re keen to try it on actual DOS hardware, **[visit the UESP page](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Daggerfall:Files)** to find out how to get the original version.

Explore the cosmos once again as captain of the Vindicator! The original developers (Toys for Bob) have released the source code for the space exploration hit _Star Control II_ to the public in 2002. This has since been picked up by a [team of programmers](http://sc2.sourceforge.net/team.php) and has been relaunched as _Ur-Quan Masters_, completely free on the PC.

</div>

Due to the open source license, there are some spin-offs you can enjoy too. _[Ur Quan Masters HD](https://sourceforge.net/projects/urquanmastershd/)_ [](https://sourceforge.net/projects/urquanmastershd/) is working on making a high-def graphic version of the game with great success so far. _[Project 6014](https://code.google.com/archive/p/project6014/)_ – which has now been discontinued – made great strides to make a spiritual successor to _Star Control II_, and progressed far before they closed down. It is still well-worth a look if you are interested in a sequel.

Interesting to note that this is actually a _port_ of the **3DO** edition, as supposedly the DOS source code has since been lost. There are also great strides to [port UQM to many different platforms](https://web.archive.org/web/20181116225136/http://wiki.uqm.stack.nl/The_Ur-Quan_Masters) (Wayback link, website was down at the time of writing).

### OpenRA – Command & Conquer (1995 – 1997)

Hitler never existed, and instead the Stalin-lead Soviet Union begins to conquer the Eastern realm in the name of Communism. You mobilse your allied forces to repel the invasion, and defend Europe from the clutches of the red. The year of the glorious **battle is 2020** with your trusty **RTX 3080\***– Wait, what? Red Alert is from 1997 right?

Nope, the team over at **OpenRA** have made a fully open-sourced version of **Command & Conquer**. Not only that, but they have versions of the original, **Red Alert** and **Dune 2000** – Completely free.

All three legendary real-time strategy games are combined into one, fully open source package **[OpenRA](https://www.openra.net/)**.
