**Ever been watching TV in bed, socialising at a party, or ever been swinging some fire poi when you thought to yourself, “I wonder if they’ll ever make a modern version of the Atari 2600?”**

Indeed, we have all had that thought about 3 seconds ago. But don’t fret, as Atari have listened to you and taken it a step further! In steps the [Atari VCS](https://atarivcs.com/).

The Atari VCS is a very clever move from Atari to quench the thirst of retro-style enthusiasts. Yes, I avoided saying retro gamers for a reason! Not only will it come pre-loaded with tons of old classics, but they are also opening the doors for Indie titles to make their way to the Ataribox. [The box comes with Linux](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2017/09/atari-ataribox-runs-linux), which means it will likely be able to run [Itch.io](https://itch.io/) and [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/)!

Atari don’t want this to simply become another Retro throwback like the SEGA Classics, but instead want it to be able to handle some of your other interests too, such as streaming video. All of this coming in a delightfully retro box designed after the Atari 2600.
