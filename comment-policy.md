Our comment system is provided by **[Disqus](https://disqus.com/)**, a networked chat system. This is a page on the house rules. For information about your privacy, please [visit our Privacy Policy]({% link privacy-policy.md %}). Disqus is **not loaded** until you click the 'load comments' button.

## Summary

Our simple rules are as follows:

*   No offensive behaviour – keep it civil.
*   No sales, trades or advertising in the comments.
*   Illegal content will be removed upon requests.
*   URLs will require a pass through moderation.

## Commenting Etiquette

**Please be respectful** to your fellow commenters. Discussions are great for sharing useful information and helping each other out through their retro journeys. If you do not agree with a fellow fan, please express your views with civility in mind. **Disagreement discussions are perfectly fine** so long as they **don’t introduce personal attacks, doxing or flaming**.

**Posting hyperlinks will flag your comment up for moderation**, so please use URLs sparingly. Whether a post constitutes as advertising is up to the moderators discretion. Known community sites (Reddit, Wololo, psx-place, etc) will normally be approved.

You are entitled to express your opinion about this site, however please be aware that the site is run entirely free, and the **whole site is run voluntarily**. Please use [**our Discord**](https://revive.today/discord/) (or **[our Twitter](https://twitter.com/revive_today)** for public criticism) for the best chance of us seeing your views. We will try to do our best to honour constructive criticism.

### Comment Ownership

ReviveToday takes no responsibility over the comment content posted by our userbase. This includes illegal content such as non-free roms, torrents and crack distributions. As moderators, we are bound by law to remove any content we come across or are notified to, which may result in a further suspension from Disqus. Please be careful to consider the content of your comment before posting.
