# ReviveToday Contributing

Thank you for wishing to participate in contributing to the [ReviveToday website][rt]. This will guide you through how to make a successful contribution to the website content.

Pull Requests are a tight-run ship here, since the website is typically solo-edited. The content on this site follows a [**Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license**][l], so you are welcome to create spin-off sites so long as attribution is given back to ReviveToday (please credit ReviveToday, not the author soup-bowl).

## Contribution Types

### Issues

Issue submissions of the following nature are appreciated (ensure they're tagged properly):

- Content suggestions.
- Fixes and amendments to articles.
- Website bug reports.

Queries outside of these are better off [emailed to the website owner][rte].

### Pull Requests

We accept pull requests of the following contribution types:

- Guest blog articles.
- Additional informational pages.
- Fixes to article content, such as image URL fixes, spelling adjustments, etc.

**Small suggestions** are far more likely to be accepted. If you plan to make *bigger* adjustments (new article page, content restructure, changing images, etc), **please discuss your proposed changes in an appropriate issue first**. Uniformity and clarity is a key component of ReviveToday articles, so changes will be scrutinised and potentially rejected.

Articles are to be written in [an active tone](https://monzo.com/tone-of-voice/).

There is ongoing work to provide contribution attribution via a JavaScript widget at the footer of articles. This has yet to be completed.
