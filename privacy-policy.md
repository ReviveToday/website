## Quick Summary

Our **comment system** – powered by **Disqus** – is now the **only client cookie using feature** on this site. This is disabled by default, and will only store cookies on your machine when you open the comment panel.

Disqus has been instructed not to collect anything outside of strictly necessary (login system, basically). They also provide their own opt-out element.

## What personal data we collect, and why we collect it

### Comments

Our comment system is provided by [Disqus](https://help.disqus.com/terms-and-policies/disqus-privacy-policy) and governed by our [Comment Policy](https://revive.today/comment-policy/). Disqus is a third party comment network. This helps us to provide a more engaging experience by allowing for fully-featured comments to be used, and can be authenticated by popular means. We do not collect any data from this process, and all information is stored on Disqus servers. We have rejected the ability to analyse our visitors via this means, however Disqus will still collect information for the purposes of identifying your user and social accounts if you have used the service prior to arriving to this site.

**In late 2019 we changed how Disqus operates on our site**. We now operate with the comments box closed until you decide to click on it. This helps keeps the tracking comments off until you wish to participate in the discussion, and not track you as you travel across our site.

### Contact forms

When a contact form on our site is filled in, it is automatically processed into an email and sent to the website administrator. Outside of this email, the data is not stored within the website and is soon purged after the request was made.

### Embedded content from other websites

Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

### Analytics

The analytics for this site are collected by Cloudflare, our security provider. This **does not use cookies** to track you. Data is instead collected depending on geographic load, and is not identified on connection (e.g. if you switched VPN hosts, we’d see it as two different connections). Any data collected is completely anonymous. We have as much insight to our usage as a nightclub bouncer with a tally clicker.

## Who we share your data with

Nobody. We love retro gaming and so do you, but we do not distribute such information to other individuals and/or companies.

## How long we retain your data

If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognise and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.

## What rights you have over your data

You can request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.
